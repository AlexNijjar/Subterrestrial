Subterrestrial adds new structures, Underground Cabins. These are stacked two-to-three-story subsurface houses that are
based on Terraria's [Underground Cabins](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Underground_Cabin) They contain
one main chest and multiple smaller chests, furniture and
workstations throughout the structure.

- Biome variations: Eight different cabin types, depending on the biome: Default, Deepslate, Desert, Mesa, Taiga, Ice,
  Jungle and Ocean.
- Cabin variations: Cabins feature random loot, rooms, degradation, foliage and destruction. No two cabins are the same!
