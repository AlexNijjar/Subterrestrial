# Subterrestrial

Subterrestrial adds new structures, Underground Cabins. These are modular two-to-three-story subsurface houses that are
based on Terraria's [Underground Cabins](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Underground_Cabin). They contain one main
chest and multiple smaller chests, furniture and workstations throughout the structure.

## Features

- Biome variations: Eight different cabin types, depending on the biome: Default, Deepslate, Desert, Mesa, Taiga, Ice,
  Jungle and Ocean.
- Cabin variations: Cabins feature random loot, rooms, degradation, foliage and destruction. No two cabins are the same!

## Integrations

- [The Extractinator:](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-extractinator) The main chest is replaced with an extractinator,
  allowing for a convenient way to obtain one.
- [Additional Additions:](https://modrinth.com/mod/addadd) Some chests occasionally contain Additional Additions loot.
- [Croptopia:](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/croptopia-fabric) Some chests occasionally contain Croptopia
  food and cookware.
- [Modern Industrialization](https://modrinth.com/mod/modern-industrialization)
  / [Tech reborn:](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/techreborn) Some chests occasionally contain tech loot.
