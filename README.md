# Subterrestrial

Subterrestrial adds new structures, Underground Cabins. These are stacked two-to-three-story subsurface houses that are based on Terraria's [Underground Cabins](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Underground_Cabin). They contain one main chest and multiple smaller chests, furniture and workstations throughout the structure.

## Features

- Biome variations: Eight different cabin types, depending on the biome: Default, Deepslate, Desert, Mesa, Taiga, Ice, Jungle and Ocean.
- Cabin variations: Cabins feature random loot, rooms, degradation, foliage and destruction. No two cabins are the same!
